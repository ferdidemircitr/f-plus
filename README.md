# f-plus
I tried to make an application similar to platforms such as Prime Video, Netflix and Disney Plus, which are widely used in this project.

In the project, investment data such as stock market, foreign exchange, bitcoin, precious metals were obtained using APIs.
The data was stored in CoreData for cases where we do not have an internet connection 
(The project works with CoreData, but the commands that work with SQLite are also included in the project file, only SQLite installation is required).
