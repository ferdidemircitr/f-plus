# f-plus
I tried to make an application similar to platforms such as Prime Video, Netflix and Disney Plus, which are widely used in this project.

In this project, series and movie information was obtained by using api. Firebase was used for session operations. The MVVM model was used, in which we separated the layers from each other and directed the relationships between these layers.
